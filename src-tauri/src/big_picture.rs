//! Big Picture: Omoio across the whole screen, used from the sofa with a pad.
//!
//! It is the same window, filling the screen and drawing the interface made
//! for a controller. A game started from it fills the screen too. Pressing
//! View and Menu together during a game takes the game off the screen and
//! brings Big Picture up, with the game still running behind it, the way
//! Steam's own button brings up Steam. The same two again, or Resume, put the
//! game back.
